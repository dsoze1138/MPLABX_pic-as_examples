# Examples PIC16F877A
--------------------

Example for PIC16F877A that shows building an assembly language project for a mid range PIC16F.

In this example an HC-SR04 ultrasonic range finder is integrated with the HD44780 LCD character module in a Microchip PICDEM2+ (DM163022) demo board. 

Note that the DM163022 is an obsolete product no longer available from Microchip or its distributors.

The project requires that the XC8 compiler tool chain is installed (v2.40) was used in the example. Not all of the syntax used in this code is supported by the earlier version of the pic-as assembler.

Note that the version of MPLABX prior to v5.40 do not support the pic-as assembler tool chain.

Note that the MPLABX often requires a manual integration with the pic-as assembler tool chain.

The comments in this code are sparse and cryptic. The implementation method is not described well. You are getting what you paid for.
