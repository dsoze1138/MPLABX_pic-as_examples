# Examples PIC16F877A
--------------------

Example for PIC16F877A that shows building an assembly language project for a mid range PIC16F.

In this example an HC-SR04 ultrasonic range finder is integrated with the HD44780 LCD character module in a Microchip PICDEM2+ (DM163022) demo board. 

Note that the DM163022 is an obsolete product no longer available from Microchip or its distributors.

The project requires that the MPASMWIN tool chain installed with MPLAB version 8.92.

The comments in this code are sparse and cryptic. The implementation method is not described well. You are getting what you paid for.

This is a response to a question on the Microchip forum:
